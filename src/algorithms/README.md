## Part 1: Algorithms

This part is meant to test your general Typescript skills.
There's no need for any graphical elements in this part - focus on the functions themselves.

Make sure you:
* 🧪 Include tests!
* ⚡ Consider performance versus readability
* 🚫 Don't modify input and return types.

### Remove identical letters

Write a function that finds and removes instances of four identical consecutive lowercase letters. The function should delete as a few letters as possible.

Assume that the maximum length of the string is 150 000 however please elaborate on changes you would do if the maximum length would be 20 million or higher?

Examples:
```
"ffdttttyy" should return "ffdtttyy"
```

```
"iiikigggg" should return "iiikiggg"
```

### Maximum odd sum

Write a function that takes an array of numbers and returns the maximum sum of two numbers whose digits have an odd sum.

Assume that the array contains between 1 and 150 000 elements and that each element is within the range of 1 to 1 500 000.

Examples:
```
[19, 2, 42, 18] should return 61
```

```
[61, 32, 51] should return 93
```
