## Part 2: Credit Card Component

This part will test your React/Web skills and your ability to use domain specific logic to create a good user experience.

The assignment is to create a credit card form component that can be dropped in to any React application and be used to process payments.

You can assume that the payment endpoint expects a `POST` request at `/api/payments` and that the credit card information will be received without any sort of encryption or obfuscation.

Make sure you:
* ðŸ§ª Include tests!
* ðŸ¤” Consider what can be validated/detected without making a request to the payment server.
* ðŸ’¥ Focus on the user experience from a functionality point of view.


Here is some inspiration in case you need it!
